Project Overview:

The Event Ticket Booking System is a console-based Java application built using JDBC 
that allows event organizers to manage events and ticket bookings efficiently. 
The system supports event creation, viewing event details, ticket booking, booking cancellation, 
and safe event removal while maintaining transactional integrity.

This project demonstrates real-world implementation of JDBC connectivity, layered architecture (DAO + Service pattern), 
transaction management, exception handling, and relational database design.

Objective:
To design and implement a structured Java application that:
Manages event records
Handles ticket bookings with seat availability validation
Prevents overbooking using transactional control
Supports booking cancellation and seat restoration
Ensures safe deletion of events with no active bookings
